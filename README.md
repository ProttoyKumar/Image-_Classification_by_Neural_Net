Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST:
This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset — a benchmark dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
A simple neural network is implemented and trained to recognise digits with high accuracy, categorising each image into one of 10 classes
